// Removes the ads Hulu stitches into its Android TV on-demand manifests.
//
// Hulu TV runs on a native WebKit engine, so there is no Java player to patch.
// Instead this loads a bundled native library (libhuluhook.so) at
// WKFapplication.onCreate; the library hooks SSL_read inside libwkf_support.so
// and strips the ad Periods from each DASH manifest in-process before Hulu's
// native parser reads it, padding the result to the manifest's original length
// so the HTTP body size is unchanged. No root.
//
// The injection design and the bundle/load patches follow ajstrick81's
// native-adstrip-toolkit (GPL-3.0). See the NOTICE file. Live broadcast
// commercials are part of the broadcast and still play.
