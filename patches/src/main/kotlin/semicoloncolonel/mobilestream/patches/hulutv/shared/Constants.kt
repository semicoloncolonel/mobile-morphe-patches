// Hulu's Android TV app (com.hulu.livingroomplus) is a native WebKit (WKF)
// engine app: the dex is JNI shims only, and the player, manifest and ad logic
// live in libwkf_support.so (libcurl + OpenSSL). It cannot be dex-patched like
// the phone app (com.hulu.plus). Instead this bundles a native library and
// loads it at WKFapplication.onCreate; the library hooks SSL_read inside
// libwkf_support.so (an exported symbol) and strips the stitched ad Periods
// from the DASH manifest in-process, with no root.
//
// The native interception approach, and the bundle/load patch scaffolding,
// follow ajstrick81's native-adstrip-toolkit (GPL-3.0). The manifest
// period-stripping follows HuluMpdFilter (the phone patch), itself after
// ajstrick81's PlutoDashManifestProbe. A separate package from the Hulu phone
// patch, so the two never collide.
