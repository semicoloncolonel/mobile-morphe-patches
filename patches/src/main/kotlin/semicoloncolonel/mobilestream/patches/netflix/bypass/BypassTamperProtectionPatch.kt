// Lets a re-signed Netflix build run without tripping its native tamper guard.
//
// Netflix ships a native integrity guard that reads the install's signing
// certificate independently of any Java-level hook. On a re-signed build it
// kills its own process a few seconds after launch (a plain kill(getpid(),
// SIGKILL) routed through libc). This loads a bundled native library
// (libnfkill.so) at the very start of the Application's attachBaseContext;
// the library inline-hooks libc's kill primitives and swallows the fatal
// signal, so the app survives and plays. Widevine stays L1/HD. No root.
//
// The signing change is what the user does when they patch and install; this
// patch only keeps the app alive afterwards. It must load before onCreate, so
// the hook is armed before the guard first fires.
